# Thesis_DDF_Code

This repository is a sum of the basics of DDF prinicpals. In our first folder, the Taylor Method DDF folder, we have the code from our very first attempts with making DDF work. This simple method works well for polynomial systems. In the folder is a python script for running it as well as a jupyter notebook depicting how to go about using it.

The next folder of interest is the RBF Folder which includes three pairs of python scripts and jupyter notebooks. These pairs include code for performing DDF with the Gaussian RBF, the Gaussian plus (first order) polynomial, and the Multiquadric RBF.

The final folder is the time delay embedding folder, which includes an example of solving the forecast for the x dimension of the Lorenz 1963 system when only the x dimension is observed/trained on.
